# Modules

One of the promises of Lowgular is that you do not have to worry about NgModules.
As long as you use Lowgular actions, you will not need to manage it yourself.

In case you encounter issues with modules, please [submit an issue on our github repo](https://github.com/Lowgular/extension-documentation/issues)

## Single Angular Modules

Whenever you create the entity like **Component**, **Directive** or **Service**, the Lowgular will automatically **create** and **manage** module for each of this entity.

This is great because you create a modular setup that is easy to **test**, **extend** and **replace**.

This module strategy allows us to create **loosely coupled** and **highly cohesive** code base.

## Standalone
